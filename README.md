Here is where we are going to talk about how awesome our project is and what it does exactly.

We should include images and such to really help the readers visualize what we are doing.

Hash Table Algorithm:

To run it how I (Keaton) am testing it first download the most updated files, if this doesn't work let me know and I'll fix it, then in your terminal run this command: [ g++ edgeListRunner.cpp ]

Then select option 1 by entering '1' - this asks you what file you wish to open up

Enter the file 'testcount.txt' - this is just a simple text file to see if it will open up

Then you are brought back to the menu, now select option 2 by pressing '2' - this will run the 'Dynamically Localized BFS Algorithm', that we still need to write, and then it spits out some BS which just is what is stored in the file.

Message me if you have any questions or need help.
